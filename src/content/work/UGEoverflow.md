>### StackOverflow Clone Project

In the context of our backend development course, we embarked on an exciting project that allowed us to put into practice the principles of web development and the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. Our project, titled "StackOverflow Clone," aimed to create a simplified and functional version of the renowned StackOverflow platform, which serves as a popular Q&A hub for the developer community.

#### Technologies Used

To successfully complete this project, we harnessed a range of cutting-edge technologies that are fundamental to web development and backend programming. Here are the key technologies we employed:

- **Languages**: Java, JavaScript, Bash
- **Framework**: Spring Boot
- **Template Engine**: Thymeleaf
- **Database**: H2
- **Dependency Management**: Maven
- **JavaScript Bundler**: Rollup
- **Frontend**: Hotwired Turbo
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS

#### Project Objective

The primary goal of our "StackOverflow Clone" project was to create a web application that would allow users to ask questions, provide answers, and engage with other community members. Our aim was to replicate the StackOverflow experience by providing a platform where developers could share their knowledge, pose technical questions, and receive relevant answers.

As part of this project, we also had the exciting opportunity to develop a custom search algorithm. This aspect of the project enabled us to put our problem-solving skills into action and create an intelligent search strategy to deliver the best answers to questions posed on the platform. We had the freedom to design our own algorithm and provide a rationale for our choice.

Throughout this article, we will delve into the various stages of developing our "StackOverflow Clone Project," starting with database design, the implementation of the backend using Spring Boot, the creation of the user interface with Thymeleaf and Tailwind CSS, and the deployment of our innovative search algorithm. We hope this project serves as inspiration for your own web development endeavors.
